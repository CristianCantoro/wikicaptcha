wikicaptcha is an attemp to build a ReCAPTCHA-like[1], CAPTCHA system[2] to
help correcting errors found in digitalization and collaborative transcriptions
done on Wikisource[3], a Wikipedia's sister project.

Wikisource aims to build a free (as in freedom) digital library, books in 
Wikisource are released with a Creative Commons BY-SA license or are otherwise
available to redistribute, copy, modify (e.g books which are in the Public 
Domain)


== History ==
The history of the idea of using CAPTCHAs (and ReCAPTCHA in particular) on
Wikipedia to aid digitization of books is a long one, as testified by its 
insertion among the "Perennial proposals" page[4].

However, in the case of Wikisource, the presence of a considerable amount of
digitized books led some Wikisources in the Italian language community[5]
to wonder if it was possible to use a similar system to help in the steps which
characterize the insertion of a book in Wikisource, expecially in the 
proofreading phase.

An user of it.wikisource, Alex brollo[6] discovered that OCRed Djvu files
contained a text layer which could be extracted and analyzed. The characters 
for which the OCR was dubious were marked with a caret ("^").

The idea is to set a system which exploits these features to build a ReCAPTCHA-
like system to help correct for these dubious recognitions, as first proposted
here[7].
